## Project Description
AluraMidi is a digital soundboard that simulates a musical keyboard, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This innovative project allows users to play various drum kit sounds by interacting with a grid of buttons. Each button on the 3x3 grid represents a different drum sound, such as a snare, cymbal, or bass, providing an intuitive and fun way to create rhythm patterns directly from your web browser.
